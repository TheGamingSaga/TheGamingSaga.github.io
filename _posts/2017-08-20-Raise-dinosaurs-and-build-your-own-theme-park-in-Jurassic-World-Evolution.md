Frontier Developments, the team behind the space exploration simulator Elite Dangerous, announced its new game Jurassic World Evolution today alongside their first trailer. The game aims to expand on the official Jurassic World mythology and puts players in charge of one of the cinematic world’s greatest tourist attraction. Players will have the opportunity to create and manage their own Jurassic World. Let’s hope you don’t run into too many of these situations:

Jurassic World Evolution will be coming to PC, PS4, and Xbox One in the summer of 2018. Previously, fans could manage their own dino theme park in Jurassic World The Game only on mobile, but soon, PC and console owners will be able to jump into a Rollercoaster Tycoon-esque Jurassic World.   “As long-time fans of the entire Jurassic series we’re thrilled to be putting players in charge of their own Jurassic World,” said Frontier’s Chief Creative Officer, Jonny Watts. “We’re excited to bring over fifteen years of management, simulation, and creature development expertise to a destination and franchise that remains an inspiration to us.” 

Delving deeper into the Jurassic World 2015 film franchise, the game revolves around putting the player in control of the operations on the island of Isla Nublar and the surrounding islands of the Muertes Archipelago. The game will allow players to build their own Jurassic World through bioengineering new dinosaur breeds, building attractive attractions to entice visitors, establishing research facilities, and making sure containment facilities are up to par. The choices players make will lead them down different paths and challenges when “life finds a way.”   To stay up to date on the Jurassic World game, visit or follow Jurassic World Evolution’s social links here.
